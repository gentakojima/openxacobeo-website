  title: About II Open Xacobeo
  p1: The Second Xacobeo Disc Golf Open will be held during Holy Week 2022, <strong>from 15th to 17th April 2022</strong>, in <strong>Santiago de Compostela</strong>, a monumental city in Galicia whose old town is a World Heritage Site and attracts visitors and pilgrims from all over the world.
  p2: Although the most popular form of access is on foot, the city is well communicated at national and international level and an airport 14 kms from the centre and only 7 kms from Monte Do Gozo, where the disc golf course is located.
  p3: We hope this second edition will be as successful as the previous one, and we are confident that the tweaks to the course design will make it even more challenging.
  flights: Santiago de Compostela is connected through airport to most parts of Europe, with nearly 20 flights every week to France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, UK, Ireland and more. Check all the available flights at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-to-santiago-de-compostela-scq">FlightConnections</a>.
