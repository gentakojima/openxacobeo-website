Tied players will be required to play **holes 18, 16 and 17** repeteadly until one of them wins a hole outright.

According to [2022 PDGA's Rules](https://www.pdga.com/news/pdga-official-rules-disc-golf-competition-manual-updated-2022) (Sec. 1.09), the specific order in which players tee off for sudden-death play shall be determined by random draw.

In the case of a tied hole during sudden-death play, the teeing order for the next hole will rotate from the order used on the just completed hole.
