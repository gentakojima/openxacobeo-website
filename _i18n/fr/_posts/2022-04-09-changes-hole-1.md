Unfortunately, as a result of ongoing works on the area of the amphitheatre, the Open Xacobeo organization team has been forced to replace the par 5 hole 1 with a shorter but still challenging par 4.

The new placement of hole 1 is very close to the original one -- just next to the bar -- although with a significant different configuration. It spans over a quite open area for the first 120m, before entering a well-guarded basked in the woods. We encourage players to check out the updates on the [caddie book](https://www.openxacobeo.com/files/caddybook.pdf) to learn more.
